# LunaBot
Discord bot made in C# with the use of Entity for a SQL database.

The purpose of this bot will be:
- Manage a custom profile for each user
- Prevent raids and moderate new users
- Allow the use of personalized rooms
- More to come as I work on it!


What's going on? Where do I start?
I've outlined the basic structure of this repo below:
- Engine.cs: contains all the starting parts of the bot and it branches to everywhere from here.
- Program.cs: Starting point of the program.
- Commands: All the commands for users, mods, and admins.
